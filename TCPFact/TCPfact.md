### If you search up the question in google the first result will show, "The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first wide-area packet-switching network with distributed control and one of the first networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet." So the flag is, "flag{ARPANET}."
