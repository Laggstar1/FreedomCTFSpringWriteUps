## Website

### When you translate, "Hähnchen" in English, you get, "Chicken". You should then search up, "German Chicken Programming Language" in Google.

![Search](./Search)

### Then, on the website, it shows how text is encoded, "The chicken language translator translates an entered text into the German chicken language, which is a language game. Using this secret language, which is spoken syllable by syllable, it is possible to communicate content, which others should not be able to understand. The vowels (a, e, i, o, u) of a word are replaced by the following letters: after a vowel, the letter h and again the vowel have to be inserted, followed by the syllable "def" and again the vowel. Thus, an "a" is transformed to "ahadefa", an "e" is transformed to "ehedefe", and so on. All consonants remain the same." You should use that description to find the flag.

### Once you do this, you should get, flag{that_was_egg-traordinary}.
